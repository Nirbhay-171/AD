The Elderly Care Prototype is a Python application that generates weekly nutrition and exercise plans for individuals aged 65 and above. Users input their name, age, and health conditions through a simple GUI, and the program produces randomized plans. The output is displayed in a tabular format, showing days of the week horizontally and nutrition and exercise plans vertically for each day. The prototype prioritizes brevity, displaying two exercises and two nutrition plans per day. This tool aims to provide a user-friendly and personalized approach to promote a healthy lifestyle for the elderly.
